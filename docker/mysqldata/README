The full version can be acquired [here](https://github.com/ja-thomas/OMLbots/tree/master/snapshot_database).
Be advised that the startup time of the docker container with this version will likely be several hours due to the import time.

The stripped down version, which only contains task_id = 3 can be found [here](https://depot.tu-dortmund.de/n6v6s).
This can be imported in less than a minute on our testing machines.
